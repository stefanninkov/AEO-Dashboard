Unlike traditional SEO which targets search rankings, AEO focuses on structured data, direct answer formatting, and entity authority to ensure AI systems reference your content."

AEO emphasizes schema markup, concise answer formatting, entity clarity, and E-E-A-T signals that help large language models identify and cite authoritative sources."
