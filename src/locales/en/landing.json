    "paragraph2": "**While SEO and AEO share common foundations, they differ in target systems, success metrics, and optimization techniques.** SEO optimizes for crawlers and ranking algorithms; AEO optimizes for language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.

The most effective digital strategies now combine both approaches to maximize visibility across traditional and AI-powered search.",

      "question": "What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?",
      "answer": "Answer Engine Optimization is the practice of optimizing website content to be cited by AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Bing Copilot. Unlike traditional SEO which targets search rankings, AEO focuses on structured data, direct answer formatting, and entity authority to ensure AI systems reference your content. AEO encompasses GEO (Generative Engine Optimization), a research-validated approach from Princeton and Georgia Tech that provides experimentally proven techniques for maximizing AI citation probability."
    },
    "1": {
      "question": "How is AEO different from traditional SEO?",
      "answer": "While SEO optimizes for search engine rankings and click-through rates, AEO optimizes for AI citation and inclusion in generated answers. AEO emphasizes schema markup, concise answer formatting, entity clarity, and E-E-A-T signals that help large language models identify and cite authoritative sources."
    },
    "2": {
      "question": "Which AI platforms does AEO Dashboard support?",
      "answer": "AEO Dashboard supports testing and optimization across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews (Gemini), Bing Copilot, Claude, and other major AI answer engines. The multi-engine testing lab lets you compare how your content appears across all platforms simultaneously."
    },
    "3": {
      "question": "How long does it take to see results from AEO?",
      "answer": "Most users see measurable improvements in AI citations within 2-4 weeks of implementing the checklist recommendations. Schema markup changes are typically picked up by AI crawlers within days, while content structure improvements may take 1-2 weeks to be reflected in AI-generated answers."
    },
    "4": {
      "question": "Can I use AEO Dashboard for client work?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. AEO Dashboard is built for agencies and SEO professionals managing multiple clients. The Professional plan includes client portals with branded, shareable dashboards, and the Enterprise plan offers white-label capabilities for a fully branded experience."
    },
    "5": {
      "question": "What does the 99-point checklist cover?",
      "answer": "The checklist spans 7 phases of AEO optimization: technical foundation, schema markup, content structure, entity optimization, multi-platform targeting, AI crawler access, and ongoing monitoring. It integrates GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) techniques throughout — research-validated methods for maximizing AI citation probability. Each task includes implementation guidance and tracks completion across your entire team."
